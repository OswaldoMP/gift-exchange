# ExchangeClient

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.3.17.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Deploy to GitHub Pages

Pushing to `main` triggers `.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml`, which installs dependencies, runs a production build, and publishes `dist/exchange-client/browser` to GitHub Pages. The workflow automatically uses `/gift-exchange/` as the base href unless you define a repository variable `BASE_HREF` (set it to `/` when serving from a custom domain). See `docs/github-pages.md` for the DNS checklist and instructions to switch between the default URL (`https://oswaldomp.github.io/gift-exchange/`) and `app-shop.me`.
